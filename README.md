# The Pizza Shop

This project handles the administration and orders of the pizza shop as a REST service written in Ruby on Rails.

## Architecture

The following patters are used in the project

* **MVC** - *Model View Controller* - This pattern divides the business logic, the representation and the management of events and the comunications, using three components, model, view and controller. 

We can see the application of the pattern in the next diagram: https://goo.gl/bhihMw

* **REST** - *Representational State Transfer* - Rest web services provides the ability to access representations of web resources using http requests. You can request data, or execute operations over some data. 

The project uses JSON for the communication.
